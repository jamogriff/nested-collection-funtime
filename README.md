## Nested Collection Funtime!

This is a small repo of three curated problems that highlight useful manipulations of nested collections. The main file `nested_collection_practice.rb` contains the RSpec tests that need to pass, and your code goes directly in each test to complete the problem. The `expectations.rb` file contains the ideal data structures that RSpec is testing against and serve as a good place to see what the ending data structure should look like. Finally, `restaurant_hash.rb` contains a large nested hash that has to be parsed in problem #3.

### Note
These problems were taken from lecture exercises and the `advanced_nested_collections.rb` exercise from Turing School of Software and Design.
